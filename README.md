# Bike Assignement 
Introduction - A US Bike Sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona Pandemic.
The company is finding it very difficult to sustain the current market situation.  In such as attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the 
demand for shared bikes among the people. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people’s needs once the situation gets
better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profit.

## General Information
Goal 
The Company wants to know – 
i). Variables that are significant in predicting the demand. 
ii). How well those variables describe the bike demand.

Solution Context 
For this business problem we need to understand the data. The data anomalies needs to be rectified. We need to model the demand of the bikes with the variables identified. 
We need to prepare the data by analyzing the datasets and data dictionary. 
Prepare the data by Data by identifying variables. 
Build the data model to identify which variables are significant for the demand of the shared bikes. 
Evaluate the data model to meet the demand level and customer expectations.

## Conclusions
Temperature had positive correlation with demand of bikes.
On holidays there is decrease in demand. There is continuous growth in demand till June. September month has highest.
With increase in humidity demand gets decreases. 
Count has correlation with Temp and Atemp. 
Difference between R-Square and Adjusted R-Square values are minimal hence, it would be safe to say no additional parameters can be removed. 
Variables which can be used to predict the demand are holiday, temp, windspeed, hum, season, months
